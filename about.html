                        <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                        <p>My current body of work fuses graphic geometries with landscapes. This collection explores the contrasts between organic and man-made, natural and industrial, and traditional and modern.</p>
                        <p>Materials do go to waste in my studio. They are repurposed into artwork that explores compositions to foster creativity throughout my art making process. This is my Excess Paint series, or EPs for short.</p>

                        <h2>About</h2>
                        <p>I am an artist, designer, and educator currently based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. With a Master of Science in Visual Art Education and a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Industrial Design, I bring a unique perspective to my work that bridges the gap between traditional art forms and contemporary design.</p>
                        <p>My practice spans multiple disciplines, from painting and graphic design to teaching art and design at international schools. I have had the privilege of working and creating in various countries, including Cambodia, Korea, Taiwan, and the United States, which has deeply influenced my artistic vision.</p>
                        <p>Through my work, I explore the intersection of geometric abstraction and natural landscapes, creating pieces that challenge perceptions and invite viewers to see the world through a different lens.</p>
